## Hi there 👋

I'm Migraal, a Full Stack Website Developer based in the Netherlands.

I mostly work on frontend development using React, Tailwind, and other modern tools. For UI, I like to use Figma to gather inspiration or sketch ideas, so I can build projects that not only work well but also look great.

### My Story 🔥

I started coding about two years ago when I was 13. Back then, I began making websites using HTML and CSS, and I immediately fell in love with it. The more I practiced, the more I wanted to learn, which is why I’m now a Full Stack Developer. I’m still learning TypeScript and backend technologies to level up even further.

My goal is to start my own business when I’m 16 or older in the Netherlands, you’re allowed to run a business on your own at that age. I’m also really interested in learning game development because creating games seems like an amazing way to combine creativity and coding.
